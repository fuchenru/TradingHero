The story begins with our realization and understanding of the challenges faced by semi-professional retail tradersâ€”individuals who consider themselves professional but often lack the necessary tools and insights. These traders typically have setups with multiple monitors, each tracking different pieces of information such as news, stock charts, company financial reports, and overall market sentiment.  


We recognize that these traders need a way to integrate and analyze fundamental, technical, and news data in real-time. This integration is important for making informed short-term trading decisions efficiently, without the need to manually interpret large amounts of information.
