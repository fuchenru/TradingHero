Trading Hero Financial Sentiment Analysis You can find our model on our Hugging Face page ü§ó: https://huggingface.co/fuchenru/Trading-Hero-LLM 

To build the sentiment analysis model, we fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT-based model using sequential training on eight different datasets. Each dataset represents a unique domain or time period, ensuring that the model can generalize well across various types of financial news. The model was trained and evaluated on each dataset, and the best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model: FinBERT (4.9 billion tokens, including: Corporate Reports (10-K & 10-Q): 2.5 billion tokens, Earnings Call Transcripts: 1.3 billion tokens, Analyst Reports: 1.1 billion tokens)

Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay

Learning Rate: 2e-5

Batch Size: 32

Epochs per Dataset: 1

Datasets: The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset of financial communication texts. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets as follows:

Training Set: 10,918,272 tokens

Validation Set: 1,213,184 tokens

Test Set: 1,347,968 tokens

Evaluation Metric: 

Test Accuracy = 0.908469
Test Precision = 0.927788
