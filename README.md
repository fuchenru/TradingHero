Trading Hero was inspired by the challenges faced by semi-professional retail traders who struggle with managing multiple streams of market data. These traders often rely on various platforms for technical, fundamental, and news analysis, which leads to information overload and inefficiency.

**How Trading Hero helps:**  
Trading Hero integrates all necessary data sources into a unified platform, helping traders make well-informed decisions quickly and accurately.

### üîÆ Trading Hero AI News Analysis <a name="News-Analysis"></a>
Trading Hero leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform comprehensive sentiment analysis on a vast number of news articles across different financial domains. This tool is designed to assist investors in making informed decisions by offering insights into the sentiment of articles related to specific stocks.

Overview
The Trading Hero Financial Sentiment Analysis model is trained on a wide variety of financial texts, including corporate reports, earnings call transcripts, and analyst reports. By fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT-based model, the system provides accurate sentiment analysis that helps investors gauge market sentiment towards specific stocks and sectors.

You can explore our model on our Hugging Face page ü§ó:
[Trading Hero LLM on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/fuchenru/Trading-Hero-LLM )

Model Training and Configuration
To build the sentiment analysis model, we used sequential fine-tuning on eight different datasets. Each dataset represents a unique financial domain or time period, allowing the model to generalize effectively across different types of financial news.

Model Details

Model: FinBERT (trained on a total of 4.9 billion tokens, broken down as follows):
Corporate Reports (10-K & 10-Q): 2.5 billion tokens

Earnings Call Transcripts: 1.3 billion tokens

Analyst Reports: 1.1 billion tokens

Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay

Learning Rate: 2e-5

Model Architecture

Attention Dropout Probability: 0.1 (Applies dropout to attention weights to prevent overfitting during training)

Hidden Layers:

Hidden Size: 768 (dimensionality of hidden layers, standard for BERT models)

Number of Hidden Layers: 12 (for deep learning of complex representations)

Intermediate Size: 3072 (size of the feedforward layers in each transformer block)

Attention Heads: 12 (self-attention mechanism with 12 attention heads to focus on different parts of the input)

Datasets

The model was fine-tuned using a custom dataset of financial communication texts, including corporate reports and news articles. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets:

Training Set: 10,918,272 tokens
Validation Set: 1,213,184 tokens
Test Set: 1,347,968 tokens

Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated on several metrics to ensure high performance in analyzing financial news sentiment:

Test Accuracy: 90.85%
Test Precision: 92.78%
Test Recall: 90.85%
Test F1 Score: 91.33%
